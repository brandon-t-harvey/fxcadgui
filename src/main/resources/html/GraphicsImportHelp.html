      GRAPHICS IMPORT HELP&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span style=
      "font-size:9pt;font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;, sans-serif;">The
      Graphics Import function currently supports AutoCAD DXF files.
      Details on supported DXF entities were once posted on the web
      but disappeared during the pandemic, so we will try to recreate
      that as a local document packaged with the library. Please also
      note that many of the notes below describe a larger context where
      many more facilities of our JavaFX based toolkits are in use, in
      a desktop application that supports some level of CAD. &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style=
      "font-size:9pt;font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;, sans-serif;">
      The main point of interest here is that older DXF files do
      not contain Measurement Units, so the user must either
      communicate by word of mouth or make guesses. Therefore, to
      aid in this effort and reduce iterations, we now show a
      preview of the imported graphics, with Drawing Limits
      displayed as the initial Lower Left and Upper Right corner
      coordinates. It is our hope that this will make it easier to
      select the correct Distance Unit for interpreting the scale
      factor of the DXF entities. &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style=
      "font-size:9pt;font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;, sans-serif;">
      Newer DXF files usually contain a Distance Unit, which we
      auto-select when present. Otherwise, the Distance Unit
      selector will be set to &quot;Choose One&quot;, and you will
      not be able to import the graphics into the main GUI until
      you make a choice (the Import Graphics button will be
      disabled in this case). &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style=
      "font-size:9pt;font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;, sans-serif;">It
      is important to be aware that the Distance Unit in the DXF file
      may be incorrect, for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it is user
      error, or the user may not have bothered to set it, and thus it
      got defaulted by AutoCAD. Use your best judgment, based on your
      knowledge of the venue being modeled, and axis range. &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style=
      "font-size:9pt;font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;, sans-serif;">There
      is a visual indicator (painted atop the graphics preview as a
      magenta dashed-line box) of the currently selected Drawing
      Limits Source, which initially matches the values in the
      corner coordinate editors until they are edited. In order to
      remind you of the original values of these available Drawing
      Limits Sources, the magenta box does not update to match
      edits in the corner coordinate editors. The Reset Button
      returns the corner coordinate editors to the original values
      for the currently selected Drawing Limits Source.&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style=
      "font-size:9pt;font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;, sans-serif;">Please
      note that many DXF files do not contain pre-computed Drawing
      Limits, and many others have arbitrary or unusable values,
      which becomes obvious when looking at the corner coordinates
      or the magenta box visual indicator. In such cases, we
      recommend selecting the Computed Bounds, which we generate in
      code as the tightest rectangular bounding box of all imported
      DXF entities. We pre-select Computed Bounds as the initial
      default, because it is usually the best choice, and in our
      experience most DXF files do not have trustworthy Drawing
      Limits (when present).&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style=
      "font-size:9pt;font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;, sans-serif;">The
      Graphics Import Preview window is modal, to avoid confusion
      if someone opened a project or ZIP file containing another DXF 
      and then re-saved the project with the newly imported Graphics
      File overwriting the DXF in that ZIP file, risking the danger
      of permanently losing their original DXF from the newly opened
      project or ZIP file.&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style=
      "font-size:9pt;font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;, sans-serif;">We
      recommend, when practical, that you set your Distance Unit in
      the main GUI in advance, to temporarily match the one that you
      expect to select for the DXF file, as this makes it easier to
      judge whether you want to alter the computed DXF bounds;
      either to round the numbers or to clip to just a section of
      the original drawing.&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style=
      "font-size:9pt;font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;, sans-serif;">Please
      note that the application adjusts its Prediction Plane (when
      relevant and present) and Drawing Limits (likewise) to match 
      whatever you select for the bounds of the Graphics Import action. 
      If you Cancel the Import, your Prediction Plane and Drawing Limits 
      (when relevant and present) are left in the state they were in 
      before the DXF file was loaded.&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style=
      "font-size:9pt;font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;, sans-serif;">Due
      to the large amount of memory consumed by DXF parsing and by
      the resulting graphical objects in the Sound Field, the Java
      Virtual Machine may perform a memory cleanup after you click
      either the &quot;Cancel Import&quot; button or the
      &quot;Import Graphics&quot; button, so do not be alarmed if
      the application becomes unresponsive for a few seconds (or
      more) afterwards, based on file size.&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style=
      "font-size:9pt;font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;, sans-serif;">There
      is also a new menu item to &quot;Clear Imported
      Graphics&quot; in the Edit Menu, so that you can clear
      imported DXF entities from the main GUI even if you don&#39;t
      plan to import another DXF file, and also so that you can
      recover the memory consumed by the discarded DXF entities.
      Note that this action may briefly halt the application while 
      restoring the memory for reuse.
